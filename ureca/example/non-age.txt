Abstract - An inexorable decline in maximum heart rate (mHR) progressively limits humanaerobic capacity with advancing age.
However, little isknown about the properties of pacemaker myocytes in the aged sinoatrial node.Here, we show that depressed excitability of individual sinoatrial node myocytes (SAMs) contributes to reductions in heart rate with advancing age.
The age-dependent reduction in sinoatrial node function was not associatedwith changes in β-adrenergic responsiveness, which was preserved during aging forheart rate, SAM FR, L- and T-type Ca(2+) currents, and If.

Abstract - Aging and disease are accompanied with a reduction of complex variability in the temporal patterns of heart rate.
Previous work has established the utility of entropy as anindex of disorder, for quantification of changes in heart rate complexity.However, questions remain regarding the origin of heart rate complexity and themechanisms involved in its reduction with aging and disease.
In this work we use a newly developed technique based on the concept of band-limited transfer entropyto assess the aging-related changes in contribution of respiration and bloodpressure to entropy of heart rate at different frequency bands.
Band-limited transfer entropy analysis revealed a reduction inhigh-frequency contribution of respiration to heart rate complexity (p<0.001)with normal aging, particularly in men.
These results have the potential fordissecting the relative contributions of respiration and blood pressure-relatedreflexes to heart rate complexity and their degeneration with normal aging.

We have identifiedabnormal heart rate characteristics (HRCs) that are predictive of impendingsepsis, and we have developed a summary measure of an infant's abnormal HRCsduring the neonatal hospitalization that we refer to as the cumulative HRC score (cHRC).OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increasing cHRC isassociated with an increasing risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in VLBW infants.METHOD: Data were collected on 65 VLBW infants whose HRCs were monitored while inthe neonatal intensive care unit and who were examined at 12 to 18 monthsadjusted age.

Recent research indicates that impaired heart ratevariability (HRV) may contribute to cardiovascular disease morbidity andmortality and has also been associated with social isolation.PURPOSE: We investigated associations between HRV and marital status in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).METHODS: Eighty-eight patients who were being investigated for suspected CAD (28 women, 60 men, mean age 61.6, 60% married) were recruited from three rapid accesschest pain clinics in London.
Heart rate variability was measured using 24-helectrocardiograms and analyzed using frequency and time-domain measures.RESULTS: Unmarried marital status was associated with reduced heart ratevariability as indexed by both frequency and time-domain measures, independently of age, gender, beta-blocker use, depression ratings, and subsequent diagnosis ofsignificant CAD.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that reduced heart rate variability isassociated with not being married and may contribute to the reliably observedrelationship between marital status and cardiovascular disease morbidity andmortality.

Nine weeks of interval training induced a significantincrease in MMV, VO2peak, MTP, pVT(1) and pVT(2) and decrease in systolic bloodpressure in the same way in men than in women, without any significant effect on their maximal heart rate values.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the age-related declines in aerobicindex are attenuated by a short exercise interval training sessions in women and men.

Onmultivariate analysis, age, weight, gender, mean arterial pressure, heart rate,and family history of coronary artery disease were independently associated with augmentation index in African Americans (R2, 0.46) and African Caribbeans (R2,0.49).
Age,weight, female gender, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and family history of coronary artery disease are independent predictors of higher augmentation indexin African Americans and African Caribbeans.
