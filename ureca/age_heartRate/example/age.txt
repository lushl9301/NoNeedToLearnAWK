Abstract - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new predictive model of maximal heart rate based on twowalking tests at different speeds (comfortable and brisk walking) as analternative to a cardiopulmonary exercise test during cardiac rehabilitation.DESIGN: Evaluation of a clinical assessment tool.SETTING: A Cardiac Rehabilitation Department in France.SUBJECTS: A total of 148 patients (133 men), mean age of 59 ±9 years, at the end of an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme.MAIN MEASURES: Patients successively performed a 6-minute walk test, a 200 mfast-walk test (200mFWT), and a cardiopulmonary exercise test, with measure ofheart rate at the end of each test.
The simplifiedpredictive model with the most acceptable mean error was: maximal heart rate =130 - 0.6 × age + 0.3 × HR200mFWT (R(2) = 0.24).
The relationship between training target heart ratecalculated from measured reserve heart rate and that established using thispredictive model was statistically significant (r = 0.528, p < 10(-6)).CONCLUSIONS: A formula combining heart rate measured during a safe simple fastwalk test and age is more efficient than an equation only including age topredict maximal heart rate and training target heart rate.

Abstract - We investigated age differences in associations among self-reported experiencesof tense and energetic arousal, physiological activation indicated by heart rate,and working-memory performance in everyday life.
Experiences of higher energetic arousal were associated withhigher heart rate in participants younger than 50 years of age but not inparticipants older than that, and energetic arousal was unrelated towithin-person fluctuations in working-memory performance.
Experiences of tensearousal were associated with higher heart rate independent of participants' age.

To test thishypothesis, we compared the 6-min walk test distance (6MWD) in 334 residentsliving at sea level vs. at high altitude.METHODS: We enrolled 168 healthy adults aged ≥35 years residing at sea level inLima and 166 individuals residing at 3,825 m above sea level in Puno, Peru.Participants completed a 6-min walk test, answered a sociodemographics andclinical questionnaire, underwent spirometry, and a blood test.RESULTS: Average age was 54.0 vs. 53.8 years, 48% vs. 43% were male, averageheight was 155 vs. 158 cm, average blood oxygen saturation was 98% vs. 90%, andaverage resting heart rate was 67 vs. 72 beats/min in Lima vs. Puno.
Other variables besides age and height that were associated with 6MWD include change in heart rate (4.0 m per beats/min increase above resting heart rate; p < 0.001) and percent body fat (-1.4 m per % increase; p = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: The 6-min walk test predicted a lowered functional capacity amongAndean high altitude vs. sea level natives at their altitude of residence, which could be explained by an incomplete adaptation or a protective mechanism favoringneuro- and cardioprotection over psychomotor activity.

Abstract - BACKGROUND: Projection pursuit regression, multilayer feed-forward networks,multivariate adaptive regression splines and trees (including survival trees)have challenged classic multivariable models such as the multiple logisticfunction, the proportional hazards life table Cox model (Cox), the Poisson'smodel, and the Weibull's life table model to perform multivariable predictions.However, only artificial neural networks (NN) have become popular in medicalapplications.RESULTS: We compared several Cox versus NN models in predicting 45-year all-causemortality (45-ACM) by 18 risk factors selected a priori: age; father life status;mother life status; family history of cardiovascular diseases; job-relatedphysical activity; cigarette smoking; body mass index (linear and quadraticterms); arm circumference; mean blood pressure; heart rate; forced expiratoryvolume; serum cholesterol; corneal arcus; diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases,cancer and diabetes; minor ECG abnormalities at rest.

Abstract - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate whether clinical factors, which influence heart rate variability (HRV) in the presence of undisturbed sinus rhythm, have anyassociations with HRV in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF).METHODS: One hundred ninety-seven consecutive patients with permanent AF wereincluded (122 males, 75 females, aged 64 ± 11 years, range 25-85).
Demographic and clinicalfactors were examined for their association with a reduced HRVF by means of aunivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: The reduced HRVF was associated with advanced age, clinical diagnosis ofa previous MI or dilated cardiomyopathy, presence of diabetes, depressed leftventricular function, NYHA class > II, treatment regimen, use of digoxin,diuretics or antiarrhythmic agents, nonuse of beta-blockers, and increased heart rate.
The independent determinants that sustained after multivariate analysiswere: heart rate (per 10 bpm increase, odds ratio 2.77 [1.88-4.07]), age (per 5years increase 1.43 [1.1-1.85]), depressed left ventricular EF (<30% vs higher2.26 [1.19-4.31]), and presence of diabetes (3.45 [1.1-10.85]).
This index showed also thestrongest correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction.CONCLUSION: We concluded that advanced age, left ventricular systolicdysfunction, increased heart rate, and presence of diabetes are cofactors of areduced HRV in AF patients.
