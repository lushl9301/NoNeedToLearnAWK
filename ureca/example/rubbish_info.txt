===========================
In addition, we analyzed heart rate data in children undergoingsevoflurane inductions, looking for age-related differences.METHODS: Following a sevoflurane induction, heart rates were recorded every 12 s for 3 min in 127 ASA I-II children under age 7.
The youngest children'sheart rates peaked earlier than the oldest (P < 0.001), while time to laryngealmask airway placement increased with increasing age (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal mask airway placement before an IV is a safe alternativeto the usual mask-IV-laryngeal mask airway sequence.
Heart rate changes during a sevofluraneinduction appear to be age-dependent.

After adjustment for age, gender, estimated creatinineclearance, history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, smoking, diabetesmellitus, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cholesterol ratio in multivariate linear regression models,higher AHI (standardized β = 0.12, P = 0.006), lower mean SpO2 (β = -0.13, P =0.012) and higher percentage of total sleep time with SpO2 < 90% (β = 0.12, P =0.011) were all associated with higher hs-TnI levels in separate models.Additional analyses with hs-TnI categorized in tertiles or using a differentstrategy for persons with hs-TnI levels below the LoD did not change the results.CONCLUSION: Increased obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity is independentlyassociated with higher concentrations of hs-TnI, suggesting that frequent apneas or hypoxemia in OSA may cause low-grade myocardial injury.

Shortquestionnaire assessments about their health state and physical activities.anthropometrics and vitals were measured before and after a 6-minute walk testand were previously defined as secondary outcomes.RESULTS: Age, height, weight and the heart rate after the 6MWT all predicted the distance walked according to different regression models: age was the best singlepredictor and mostly influenced walk distance in younger age, anthropometricswere more important in adolescents and females.
Heart rate after the 6MWT was an important distance predictor in addition to age and outreached anthropometrics inthe majority of subgroups assessed.CONCLUSIONS: The 6MWT in children and adolescents is feasible and practical.
The 6MWT distance depends mainly on age; however, heart rate after the 6MWT, heightand weight significantly add information and should be taken into account mainly in adolescents.

===========================
It isalso unclear to what extent scaling size-related cardiovascular determinants ofVO2max affects the interpretation of age-related differences.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of VO2max, maximal cardiac output (QCmax), TBV,and body composition including fat-free mass (FFM) in 95 (51% M) healthy adultsranging from 19-86 years.RESULTS: Absolute and indexed VO2max, QCmax, and maximal heart rate decreased in both sexes with age (p ≤ .031).
A lower arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO2diff)contributed to the reduction in VO2max with age in treadmill exercisers (p =.004) but not in the entire cohort (p = .128).CONCLUSION: These results suggest (a) a reduction in absolute SVmax, and TBV donot contribute substantially to the age-related reduction in VO2max, whichinstead results from a smaller QCmax due to a lower maximal heart rate, and (b)body composition scaling methods should be used to accurately describe the effectof aging on physical function and cardiovascular variables.

===========================
We compared seven strategies to handle vital signs as predictors of SBI (dichotomized orcontinuously in various ways).RESULTS: The dichotomous predictors, namely tachycardia and tachypnea, containinginformation on the vital sign and age showed limited value to predict thepresence of SBI (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC(ROC)]: 0.53 for heart rate and 0.55 for respiratory rate).
In comparison, amodel with age as a single continuous predictor resulted in an AUC of 0.58.Models with age and one of the vital signs included continuously showed thehighest AUC (heart rate: 0.60 and respiratory rate: 0.63).CONCLUSION: Heart and respiratory rates should be maintained as continuousvariables in model development to predict SBI in febrile children, asdichotomization results in information loss and lower predictive ability.

Abstract - BACKGROUND: Protective mechanisms that modulate and lead to habituation to painare immature in preterm newborn infants.AIMS: To evaluate if a routine non-painful handling will be perceived as painful throughout the neonatal period in newborn infants with 28-32 weeks of gestationalage.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SUBJECTS: 36 preterm infants without malformations evaluated for pain during adiaper change.OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were studied at three times (5 min prior, during, and 3 min after the diaper change) during five moments (72 h, 7, 14, 21 and 28 daysof life) by evaluation of heart rate, oxygen saturation and 3 validated painassessment tools: the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), the BehavioralIndicators of Infant Pain (BIIP) and Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP).Results were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA adjusted for gender, gestationalage at birth, number of painful procedures and use of opioids.RESULTS: Patients had, at birth, mean gestational age of 30.2±1.4 weeks,birthweight of 1257±238g, with 50% males.
The variation of oxygen saturation during the three studytimes was similar at the different post-natal ages, but heart rate variationincreased significantly from 72 h until the 28th day of life.CONCLUSIONS: In preterm infants, the non-nociceptive handling does not triggerpain responses even after 28 days of neonatal care, which includes the experienceof repetitive procedural pain.

We identify the partialvolume as primary source of potential error in the analysis of respective T1 mapsand use 1 pixel erosion to represent "midwall myocardial" T1, resulting in a 0.9%decrease to 953 ± 23 ms. Midwall myocardial ShMOLLI T1 was reproducible with anintra-individual, intra- and inter-scanner variability of ≤2%.
After correction for age and genderdependencies, heart rate was the only other physiologic factor with a smalleffect on myocardial ShMOLLI T1 (6ms/10bpm).
In the study ofcardiac conditions such as diffuse fibrosis or small focal changes, the use of"myocardial midwall" T1, age and gender matching, and compensation for heart ratedifferences may all help to improve the method sensitivity in detecting subtlechanges.

Abstract - BACKGROUND: Continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) and interbeat intervals(IBI) recordings reveal sequences of consecutive beats in which SBP and heartrate change in opposite direction, representing negative feedback baroreflexmechanisms, as well as sequences in which SBP and heart rate change in the samedirection (non-baroreflex), believed to represent feedforward control mechanisms.The present study was undertaken to assess the relationship between baroreflexand non-baroreflex sequences in end stage renal insufficiency.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Continuous beat-to-beat SBP and IBI monitoringwas performed in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD, n=72), in age-matchedpatients after renal transplantation (TX, n=41) and healthy (control) individuals(C, n=34).

Abstract - OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity of two physiological measures fordiscriminating between levels of cognitive demand under driving conditions acrossdifferent age groups.BACKGROUND: Previous driving research presents a mixed picture concerning thesensitivity of physiological measures for differentiating tasks with presumeddifferences in mental workload.METHOD: A total of 108 relatively healthy drivers balanced by gender and acrossthree age groups (20-29, 40-49, 60-69) engaged in three difficulty levels of anauditory presentation-verbal response working memory task.RESULTS: Heart rate and skin conductance level (SCL) both increased in astatistically significant fashion with each incremental increase in cognitivedemand, whereas driving performance measures did not provide incrementaldiscrimination.
SCL was lower in the 40s and 60s age groups; however, the patternof incremental increase with higher demand was consistent for heart rate and SCL across all age groups.

Abstract - PURPOSE: To examine the association between depressive symptoms and subclinicalmarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD), specifically arterial stiffness, asindexed by pulse wave velocity (PWV), and carotid artery intima media thickening (IMT), in a sample of healthy adolescents, and to explore adolescent hostility asa potential moderator of depression on subclinical markers of CVD.METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven (n = 157) black and white adolescents betweenthe ages of 16-21 completed a follow-up study of psychosocial stress andcardiovascular risk factors that included measures of PWV and carotid IMT.Psychosocial measures included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies DepressionScale (divided into tertiles), and the Cook-Medley Hostility Inventory subscales.Linear regression models controlled for sociodemographic variables, healthbehaviors, blood pressure, body mass index, and heart rate.RESULTS: Results show that more severe depressive symptoms were associated withhigher levels of PWV (B = .17, R(2) = .30, ΔR(2) = .03, confidence interval =2.2-47.0, p = .03) but not with higher IMT.

===========================
This study aimed to analyze how the facets of alexithymia interactwith autonomic reactivity as well as self- and observer-rated anxiety during asocial stress task.METHODS: With the use of a public-speaking paradigm, skin conductance levels(SCLs) and heart rate (HR) during the defined periods of baseline, preparation,stress, and recovery were assessed in 60 volunteers (42 females, mean age 22.8)categorized as having either high (HDA) or low (LDA) degrees of alexithymia.RESULTS: We found smaller SCLs during preparation and speech in the HDA group.Regression analyses indicated that only the alexithymia facet "difficulty indescribing feelings" (DDF) was associated with smaller electrodermal responses.In the HDA group, self- and observer-rated anxiety was higher in the HDA than in the LDA group, which was attributable to higher scores in the subscales"difficulty in identifying feelings" (DIF) and "externally oriented thinking"(EOT).CONCLUSIONS: Our data support and specify the decoupling hypothesis ofalexithymia by showing that the facets of alexithymia are differentially related to autonomic reactivity as well as self- and observer-rated anxiety during socialstress.

The relationshipsbetween selected echocardiographic variables and age, body weight and heart rate were analysed.RESULTS: Reference values were determined for 12 routinely used 2-D and M-modeechocardiographic variables in healthy Thoroughbred foals at increasing ageintervals.
Weak (R(2) ≤ 0.37) but significant (P < 0.001) correlations between theechocardiographic variables and heart rate were identified.CONCLUSIONS: Reference values for 2-D and M-mode echocardiographic variables inclinically normal Thoroughbred foals up to 4 months of age and approximately 190 kg body weight may assist in the interpretation of echocardiograms ofThoroughbred foals of similar age and body weight with suspected congenital oracquired cardiac disease.

We examined pain reactivity to immunization inpreterm and full-term infants.METHOD: Cortisol, facial behavior, and heart rate reactivity before, during, and after immunization were examined in infants born preterm at extremely lowgestational age (ELGA 24 to 28 wk), very low gestational age (VLGA 29 to 32 wk), and full-term, at corrected age 4 months.RESULTS: In all groups, cortisol, behavior, and heart rate increased duringimmunizations.
In contrast, facial and heart rate responses toimmunization did not differ between preterm and full-term infants.DISCUSSION: Although earlier reports found differences in pain processing inpreterm infants earlier and later in development, the present findings indicatethat pain responses, indexed by behavior and heart-rate, do not seem to differ inpreterm compared with full-term infants at 4 months corrected age.

Abstract - AIMS: We assessed changes in pulse pressure and heart rate during a squattingtest, as indirect markers of arterial stiffness and cardiovascular autonomicneuropathy, respectively, according to age and sex in patients with Type 1diabetes mellitus.METHODS: We evaluated 160 diabetic patients, divided into four groups of 20 menand 20 women according to age (G1, 20-30 years old; G2, 31-40 years old; G3,41-50 years old; and G4, 51-60 years old), and 160 non-diabetic matched controlsubjects.
Overall values throughout the test,baseline levels in initial standing position and squatting-induced changes inpulse pressure, heart rate and the pulse pressure x heart rate product werecompared between diabetic patients and healthy control subjects.RESULTS: In the standing position, a greater increase in pulse pressure and lowerreduction in heart rate with age led to a significantly higher pulse pressure xheart rate product in diabetic patients compared with control subjects.
Squatting-derived indices of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy werealso noted with increasing age in diabetic patients.CONCLUSIONS: The marked increase in the pulse pressure x heart rate product('pulsatile stress') according to age, combined with cardiovascular autonomicneuropathy, may contribute to the higher cardiovascular risk of patients withType 1 diabetes.

The objective of this paper was to determine how age-predictedheart rate formulas can be used with fibromyalgia syndrome populations as well asto find out which mathematical models are more accurate to control exerciseintensity.METHODS: A total of 60 women aged 18-65 years with fibromyalgia syndrome wereincluded; 32 were randomized to walking training at anaerobic threshold.Age-predicted formulas to maximum heart rate ("220 minus age" and "208 minus 0.7 x age") were correlated with achieved maximum heart rate (HRMax) obtained byspiroergometry.
Subsequently, six mathematical models using heart rate reserve(HRR) and age-predicted HRMax formulas were studied to estimate the intensitylevel of exercise training corresponding to heart rate at anaerobic threshold(HRAT) obtained by spiroergometry.
Linear and nonlinear regression models wereused for correlations and residues analysis for the adequacy of the models.RESULTS: Age-predicted HRMax and HRAT formulas had a good correlation withachieved heart rate obtained in spiroergometry (r = 0.642; p < 0.05).

In age-adjusted analyses within the 'lower GFRgroup', 'higher GFR group' and combined group, PWV correlated with highersystolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse pressure (PP), diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI) and resting heart rate (all P < 0.0008).
However, eGFR explained atmost 4% of the variability in PWV in age-adjusted analyses (compared with 13-15% explained by SBP, PP or diabetes) and <1% of PWV variability in models adjusting for age, SBP, diabetes, heart rate and BMI (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSION: Although eGFR may independently predict PWV, the contribution of GFR per se does not appear to be clinically meaningful when compared with traditionalcardiovascular risk factors.

We sought to compare determinants of HRR-1 and HRR-2 in OSAS and to assess whether these associations depend on age.METHODS: Exercise testing with measurements of HRR-1 and HRR-2 was performed in54 patients with untreated OSAS (median [interquartile range] apnea-hypopneaindex 27.5 [12.0-42.4] h(-1), desaturation index [DSI] 10.6 [5.1-25.0] h(-1)).RESULTS: Overall, higher DSI (P < .001) and higher total cholesterol ([TC] P =.02) were independent predictors of lower HRR-1, whereas lower peak heart rate (P< .001), higher resting heart rate (P = .006), and higher DSI (P = .01) wereindependently associated with lower HRR-2.
In the below-median age group (age<or= 48 years; n = 27), higher DSI (P = .002) was the only independent predictor of lower HRR-1, and lower peak heart rate (P < .001) and higher DSI (P = .003)were independently associated with lower HRR-2.
In contrast, in the above-median age group (age > 48 years; n = 27) higher TC (P = .006), higher insulinresistance (P = .009), and higher resting heart rate (P = .048) wereindependently associated with lower HRR-1, and lower estimated glomerularfiltration rate (P = .001), higher resting heart rate (P = .002), higher TC (P = .005), and lower peak heart rate (P = .01) were independently associated withHRR-2.CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of HRR-2 provides additional information on differentaspects of OSAS compared with HRR-1.

===========================
Abstract - INTRODUCTION: Reference values for T-wave morphology analysis and evaluation ofthe relationship with age, sex, and heart rate are lacking in the literature.
Multivariate regression was used to test fordependence of T-wave variables with the subject age, sex, and heart rate.RESULTS: Lead V5 (men vs women) T-wave variables were as follows: amplitude, 444 versus 317 muV; area, 48.4 versus 33.2 ms mV; Tpeak-Tend interval, 94 versus 92milliseconds; maximal descending slope, -5.15 versus -3.69 muV/ms; skewness,-0.24 versus -0.22; and kurtosis, -0.36 versus -0.35.
Tpeak-Tend interval,skewness, and kurtosis were independent of age, sex, and heart rate (r(2) <0.05), whereas Bazett-corrected QT-interval was more dependent (r(2) = 0.40).CONCLUSION: A selection of T-wave morphology variables is found to be clinically independent of age, sex, and heart rate, including Tpeak-Tend interval, skewness,and kurtosis.

Abstract - There are many studies with respect to the age-related change of thecharacteristics of beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV), reflected bycardiac autonomic control, especially focusing on adulthood (i.e., aging related to the incidence of metabolic syndrome) in Japanese individuals.
The HF to total power representsthe vagal control of heart rate (PNS indicator), and the ratio of LF to HF(LF/HF) is considered to relate to the sympathetic modulations (SNS indicator).Both PNS and SNS indices had substantially no effect from age and/or gender inthe range between 8 and 20 years.

Abstract - BACKGROUND: Reduced heart rate (HR) complexity (e.g., a lack of randomness orunpatterned variability) is an established predictor of trauma patient mortality.However, this finding has not been validated across the diverse spectrum oftraumatic injury, and underlying mechanisms of this relationship are poorlyunderstood.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two thousand one hundred seventy-eight trauma patientswere admitted directly to the intensive care unit (ICU), and had sufficient (>6h)continuous integer heart rate data within the first d. Patients were stratifiedby location of isolated severe injury (head, torso, both, or neither), primarymechanism (blunt or penetrating), and probability of survival, an acceptedscoring system based on age, admission vital signs, and injury type and severity.HR multiscale entropy (MSE) was calculated (sum of scales, Costa's algorithm,physionet.org, m=2, r=0.15) to estimate complexity.

ECG parameters were measured from digital 12-lead ECGs and QT intervals were adjusted for age, gender and heart rate with a nomogram (Nc)method derived from the present study population.RESULTS: The KCNE1 D85N minor allele (frequency 1.4%) was associated with a 10.5 ms (SE 1.6) or 0.57 SD prolongation of the adjusted QT(Nc) interval (P=3.6 x10(-11)) in gender-pooled analysis.
In agreement with previous studies, wereplicated the association with QT(Nc) interval with minor alleles of KCNH2intronic SNP rs3807375 [1.6 ms (SE 0.4) or 0.08 SD, P=4.7 x 10(-5)], KCNH2 K897T [-2.6 ms (SE 0.5) or -0.14 SD, P=2.1 x 10(-7)] and NOSA1P variants includingrs2880058 [4.0 ms (SE 0.4) or 0.22 SD, P=3.2 x 10(-24)] under additive models.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that each additional copy of the KCNE1 D85N minorallele is associated with a considerable 10.5 ms prolongation of the age-,gender- and heart rate-adjusted QT interval and could thus modulaterepolarization-related arrhythmia susceptibility at the population level.
