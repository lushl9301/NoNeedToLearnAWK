In radiotherapy treatment of thoracic, breast and chest wall tumors, the heart
may be included (partially or fully) in the radiation field. As a result,
patients may develop radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) several years after
exposure to radiation. There are few methods available to prevent or reverse RIHD
and the biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In order to further study
the effects of radiation on the heart, we developed a model of local heart
irradiation in rats using an image-guided small animal conformal radiation
therapy device (SACRTD) developed at our institution. First, Monte Carlo based
simulations were used to design an appropriate collimator. EBT-2 films were used 
to measure relative dosimetry, and the absolute dose rate at the isocenter was
measured using the AAPM protocol TG-61. The hearts of adult male Sprague-Dawley
rats were irradiated with a total dose of 21 Gy. For this purpose, rats were
anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a custom-made vertical rat holder.
Each heart was irradiated with a 3-beam technique (one AP field and 2 lateral
fields), with each beam delivering 7 Gy. For each field, the heart was visualized
with a digital flat panel X-ray imager and placed at the isocenter of the 1.8 cm 
diameter beam. In biological analysis of radiation exposure, immunohistochemistry
showed γH2Ax foci and nitrotyrosine throughout the irradiated hearts but not in
the lungs. Long-term follow-up of animals revealed histopathological
manifestations of RIHD, including myocardial degeneration and fibrosis. The
results demonstrate that the rat heart irradiation technique using the SACRTD was
successful and that surrounding untargeted tissues were spared, making this
approach a powerful tool for in vivo radiobiological studies of RIHD. Functional 
and structural changes in the rat heart after local irradiation are ongoing.

Heart rate and breathing rate fluctuations represent interacting physiological
oscillations. These interactions are commonly studied using respiratory sinus
arrhythmia (RSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) or analyzing cardiorespiratory
synchronization. Earlier work has focused on a third type of relationship, the
temporal ratio of respiration rate and heart rate (HRR). Each method seems to
reveal a specific aspect of cardiorespiratory interaction and may be suitable for
assessing states of arousal and relaxation of the organism. We used HRR in a
study with 87 healthy subjects to determine the ability to relax during 5
day-resting periods in comparison to deep sleep relaxation. The degree to which a
person during waking state could relax was compared to somatic complaints,
health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression. Our results show, that
HRR is barely connected to balance (LF/HF) in HRV, but significantly correlates
to the perception of general health and mental well-being as well as to
depression. If relaxation, as expressed in HRR, during day-resting is near to
deep sleep relaxation, the subjects felt healthier, indicated better mental
well-being and less depressive moods.

This study aimed to (1) quantify the respective physical workloads of bar bending
and fixing; and (2) compare the physiological and perceptual responses between
bar benders and bar fixers. Field studies were conducted during the summer in
Hong Kong from July 2011 to August 2011 over six construction sites. Synchronized
physiological, perceptual, and environmental parameters were measured from
construction rebar workers. The average duration of the 39 field measurements was
151.1 ± 22.4 min under hot environment (WBGT = 31.4 ± 2.2 °C), during which
physiological, perceptual and environmental parameters were synchronized. Energy 
expenditure of overall rebar work, bar bending, and bar fixing were 2.57, 2.26
and 2.67 Kcal/min (179, 158 and 186 W), respectively. Bar fixing induced
significantly higher physiological responses in heart rate (113.6 vs.
102.3 beat/min, p < 0.05), oxygen consumption (9.53 vs. 7.14 ml/min/kg,
p < 0.05), and energy expenditure (2.67 vs. 2.26 Kcal/min, p < 0.05) (186 vs.
158 W, p < 0.05) as compared to bar bending. Perceptual response was higher in
bar fixing but such difference was not statistically significant. Findings of
this study enable the calculation of daily energy expenditure of rebar work.

This study examined the effect of active pre-warming on speed and quality of
performance during simulated firefighting exercise. Twelve male firefighters
performed two trials in counterbalanced order. They were either pre-warmed by
20-min cycling at 1.5 Watt kg(-)(1) body mass (WARM) or remained thermoneutral
(CON) prior to a simulated firefighting activity. After the pre-warming,
gastrointestinal temperature (P < 0.001), skin temperature (P = 0.002), and heart
rate (P < 0.001) were higher in WARM than in CON. During the firefighting
activity, rating of perceived exertion, thermal sensation and discomfort were
higher for WARM than for CON. Finish time of the firefighting activity was
similar, but the last task of the activity was completed slower in WARM than in
CON (P = 0.04). In WARM, self-reported performance quality was lower than in CON 
(P = 0.04). It is concluded that pre-warming reduces the speed during the last
part of simulated firefighting activity and reduces self-reported quality of
performance.

Firemen often suffer from heat strain. This study investigated two chest cooling 
systems for use under a firefighting suit. In nine male subjects, a vest with
water soaked cooling pads and a vest with water perfused tubes were compared to a
control condition. Subjects performed 30 min walking and 10 min recovery in hot
conditions, while physiological and perceptual parameters were measured. No
differences were observed in heart rate and rectal temperature, but scapular skin
temperature and fluid loss were lower using the perfused vest. Thermal sensation 
was cooler for the perfused vest than for the other conditions, while the cool
pad vest felt initially cooler than control. However, comfort and RPE scores were
similar. We conclude that the cooling effect of both tested systems, mainly
providing a (temporally) cooler thermal sensation, was limited and did not meet
the expectations.

In new approaches based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems (ANFIS) and analytical
method, heart rate (HR) measurements were used to estimate oxygen consumption
(VO2). Thirty-five participants performed Meyer and Flenghi's step-test (eight of
which performed regeneration release work), during which heart rate and oxygen
consumption were measured. Two individualized models and a General ANFIS model
that does not require individual calibration were developed. Results indicated
the superior precision achieved with individualized ANFIS modelling (RMSE = 1.0
and 2.8 ml/kg min in laboratory and field, respectively). The analytical model
outperformed the traditional linear calibration and Flex-HR methods with field
data. The General ANFIS model's estimates of VO2 were not significantly different
from actual field VO2 measurements (RMSE = 3.5 ml/kg min). With its ease of use
and low implementation cost, the General ANFIS model shows potential to replace
any of the traditional individualized methods for VO2 estimation from HR data
collected in the field.

G protein β3 (Gβ3) is an isoform of heterotrimeric G protein β subunits involved 
in transducing G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Polymorphisms in Gβ3 
(GNB3) are associated with many human disorders (e.g. hypertension, diabetes and 
obesity) but the role of GNB3 in these pathogeneses remains unclear. Here,
Gβ3-null mice (GNB3(-/-)) were characterized to determine how Gβ3 functions to
regulate blood pressure, body weight and metabolism. We found Gβ3 expression
restricted to limited types of tissues, including the retina, several regions of 
the brain and heart ventricles. Gβ3-deficient mice were normal as judged by body 
weight gain by age or by feeding with high-fat diet (HFD); glucose tolerance and 
insulin sensitivity; baseline blood pressure and angiotensin II infusion-induced 
hypertension. During tail-cuff blood pressure measurements, however, Gβ3-null
mice had slower heart rates (~450 vs ~500beats/min). This bradycardia was not
observed in isolated and perfused Gβ3-null mouse hearts. Moreover, mouse hearts
isolated from GNB3(-/-) and controls responded equivalently to muscarinic
receptor- and β-adrenergic receptor-stimulated bradycardia and tachycardia,
respectively. Since no difference was seen in isolated hearts, Gβ3 is unlikely to
be involved directly in the GPCR signaling activity that controls heart pacemaker
activity. These results demonstrate that although Gβ3 appears dispensable in mice
for the regulation of blood pressure, body weight and metabolic features
associated with obesity and diabetes, Gβ3 may regulate heart rate.

Physical fitness and overweight among children has become paramount in the
general population and more so in children with developmental coordination
disorder (DCD). The purpose of the current study was to examine the association
between physical fitness and overweight in a sample of Israeli children in
comparison to typical children, and to examine gender differences. DCD was
identified through total scores on the movement assessment battery for children 2
(MABC-2) equal to or less than the 16th percentile as well as parents' report
that the child's deficits in motor skills interfered with at least two daily life
activities. The sample included a group of children with DCD (n=22, M age=8.70
[SD=1.36], 16 boys [73%]) and a control group of typical children (n=47, M
age=8.90 [SD=1.52], 34 boys [72%]). Measures included the strength subtest of the
Bruininks-Oseretsky test of motor proficiency (BOT-2), the six minutes' walk test
(6MWT) with heart rate measure, BMI and the percentage of body fat. Significant
differences between DCD and typical children were found on all variables of
physical fitness and weight. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis
(group/gender) also revealed significant interactions for the percentage of body 
fat (F=8.51, p<.005) and BMI (F=4.50, p<.038) meaning that less fit children are 
more obese. The current study supports previous findings that children with DCD
are less physically fit and more overweight compared to typically developing
children. Moreover, in comparing between the genders, the girls in the study
sample weighed more and had a significantly higher percentage of body fat than
boys, it is essential to further our understanding of the relationships between
obesity, physical fitness and gender among children with and without DCD.

Latent time-varying factors in longitudinal analysis: a linear mixed hidden
Markov model for heart rates.

Author information: 
(1)University of Roma Tre, Rome, Italy; Max Planck Institute for Demographic
Research, Rostock, Germany.

Longitudinal data are often segmented by unobserved time-varying factors, which
introduce latent heterogeneity at the observation level, in addition to
heterogeneity across subjects. We account for this latent structure by a linear
mixed hidden Markov model. It integrates subject-specific random effects and
Markovian sequences of time-varying effects in the linear predictor. We propose
an expectationŰ-maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, based
on data augmentation. It reduces to the iterative maximization of the expected
value of a complete likelihood function, derived from an augmented dataset with
case weights, alternated with weights updating. In a case study of the Survey on 
Stress Aging and Health in Russia, the model is exploited to estimate the
influence of the observed covariates under unobserved time-varying factors, which
affect the cardiovascular activity of each subject during the observation period.

Exercise training enhanced SIRT1 longevity signaling replaces the IGF1 survival
pathway to attenuate aging-induced rat heart apoptosis.

Cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death (9.1 %) in Taiwan.
Heart function deteriorates with age at a rate of 1 % per year. As society ages, 
we must study the serious problem of cardiovascular disease. SIRT1 regulates
important cellular processes, including anti-apoptosis, neuronal protection,
cellular senescence, aging, and longevity. In our previous studies, rats with
obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes exhibiting slowed myocardial
performance and induced cell apoptosis were reversed via sports training through 
IGF1 survival signaling compensation. This study designed a set of experiments
with rats, in aging and exercise groups, to identify changes in myocardial cell
signaling transduction pathways. Three groups of three different aged rats, 3,
12, and 18 months old, were randomly divided into aging groups (C3, A12, and A18)
and exercise groups (E3, AE12, and AE18). The exercise training consisted of
swimming five times a week with gradual increases from the first week from 20 to 
60 min for 12 weeks. After the sports training process was completed, tissue
sections were taken to observe cell organization (hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
stain) and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assays) and to observe any changes in the myocardial tissues and
proteins (Western blotting). The experimental results show that cardiomyocyte
apoptotic pathway protein expression increased with age in the aging groups (C3, 
A12, and A18), with improvement in the exercise group (E3, AE12, and AE18).
However, the expression of the pro-survival p-Akt protein decreased significantly
with age and reduced performance. The IGF1R/PI3K/Akt survival pathway in the
heart of young rats can indeed be increased through exercise training. As rats
age, this pathway loses its original function, even with increasing upstream
IGF1. However, levels of SIRT1 and its downstream target PGC-1α were found to
increase with age and compensatory performance. Moreover, exercise training
enhanced the SIRT longevity pathway compensation instead of IGF1 survival
signaling to improve cardiomyocyte survival.

Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) portends increased morbidity and mortality in
patients with heart failure. In those with advanced heart failure, heart
transplantation (HT) is the only causative therapy to increase survival. However,
little is known about the impact of symptomatic PVD on survival of HT recipients 
in large multicenter cohorts. The aim of this study was to investigate an
association between recipient symptomatic PVD and survival after HT. We analyzed 
20,297 patients from the United Network of Organ Sharing data set. Survival
analysis using a control cohort established by propensity matching was performed.
There was an increased prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in
711 patients with symptomatic PVD compared with 19,586 patients without PVD.
Patients with pretransplant symptomatic PVD had increased post-transplant
mortality compared with those without PVD (1-, 5- and 10-year survival rate 91.5%
vs 94.9%, 74.8% vs 82.6%, 48.6% vs 54.7%, respectively, log-rank p <0.001). On
multivariate analysis based on the propensity matching, factors associated with a
lower survival rate were presence of PVD (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidential
interval 1.02 to 1.42, p = 0.030), and female gender (hazard ratio 1.22, 95%
confidence interval 1.02 to 1.47, p = 0.034). In conclusion, patients with
symptomatic PVD have a lower survival rate after HT. Symptomatic PVD should be
considered an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients undergoing
HT evaluation.

The SAPIEN 3 valve (S3V) is a new-generation transcatheter valve with enhanced
anti-paravalvular leak properties, but no data comparing with earlier
transcatheter valve systems are available. We aimed to compare the hemodynamic
performance of the S3V and the SAPIEN XT valve (SXTV) in a case-matched study
with echo core laboratory analysis. A total of 27 patients who underwent
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the S3V were matched for
prosthesis size (26 mm), aortic annulus area, and mean diameter measured by
computed tomography, left ventricular ejection fraction, body surface area, and
body mass index with 50 patients treated with the SXTV. The prosthesis size was
determined by oversizing of 1% to 15% of annulus area. Doppler echocardiographic 
images collected at baseline and 1-month follow-up were analyzed in a central
echocardiography core laboratory. The need for postdilation was higher in the
SXTV group (20% vs 4%, p = 0.047), and mean residual gradient and effective
orifice area were similar in both groups (p >0.05). The incidence of paravalvular
aortic regurgitation was greater with the SXTV (≥mild: 42%, moderate: 8%) than
with the S3V (≥mild: 7%, moderate: 0%; p = 0.002 for ≥mild vs SXTV). The
implantation of an S3V was the only factor associated with trace or no
paravalvular leak after TAVR (p = 0.007). In conclusion, TAVR with the S3V was
associated with a very low rate of paravalvular leaks and need for balloon
postdilation, much lower than that observed with the earlier generation of
balloon-expandable valve (SXTV). The confirmation of these results in a larger
cohort of patients will represent a major step forward in using transcatheter
valves for the treatment of aortic stenosis.

Compared with non-smokers, cigarette smokers with ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarctions derive greater benefit from fibrinolytic therapy. However, it is not 
known whether the optimal treatment strategy after fibrinolysis differs on the
basis of smoking status. The Trial of Routine Angioplasty and Stenting After
Fibrinolysis to Enhance Reperfusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TRANSFER-AMI)
randomized patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions to a routine
early invasive (pharmacoinvasive) versus a standard (early transfer only for
rescue percutaneous coronary intervention or delayed angiography) strategy after 
fibrinolysis. The efficacy of these strategies was compared in 1,051 patients on 
the basis of their smoking status. Treatment heterogeneity was assessed between
smokers and non-smokers, and multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate for
an interaction between smoking status and treatment strategy after adjusting for 
baseline Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score. Smokers
(n = 448) were younger, had fewer cardiovascular risk factors, and had lower
GRACE risk scores. They had a lower rate of the primary composite end point of
30-day mortality, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, heart failure, or cardiogenic
shock and fewer deaths or reinfarctions at 6 months and 1 year. Smoking status
was not a significant predictor of either primary or secondary end points in
multivariable analysis. Pharmacoinvasive management reduced the primary end point
compared with standard therapy in smokers (7.7% vs 13.6%, p = 0.04) and
non-smokers (13.1% vs 19.7%, p = 0.03). Smoking status did not modify treatment
effect on any measured outcomes (p >0.10 for all). In conclusion, compared with
non-smokers, current smokers receiving either standard or early invasive
management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction after fibrinolysis have 
more favorable outcomes, which is likely attributable to their better baseline
risk profile. The beneficial treatment effect of a pharmacoinvasive strategy is
consistent in smokers and non-smokers.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk for
cardiovascular disease (CVD), although strategies to detect subclinical CVD are
poorly characterised. The purpose of this study was to assess myocardial function
by speckle-tracking echocardiography strain imaging in patients with RA without
known CVD.
METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with RA selected from a population-based sample
underwent echocardiography. Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV)
longitudinal peak systolic strain were measured. A subset of 59 patients with RA 
was compared with 59 age-, gender- and race-matched subjects with normal
echocardiography and no CVD or risk factors.
RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of the patients with RA and the normal patients was
55.7±12.1 and 54.5±12.2 years (p=0.42), respectively, with 45 (76%) women in each
group. Global LV strain (-15.7±3.2% vs -18.1±2.4%, p<0.001) and RV strain
(-17.9±4.7% vs -20.7±2.4%, p<0.001) was reduced in patients with RA compared with
normal patients. Among all 87 patients with RA the mean disease duration and
C-reactive protein at echocardiography were 10.0±6.1 years and 3.5±3.7 mg/L, and 
74% were seropositive. Adjusted univariate regression analysis demonstrated a
significant correlation between global LV strain and RA Health Assessment
Questionnaire disability index (p=0.032), and borderline associations with prior 
use of oral corticosteroids (p=0.062) and methotrexate (p=0.054) after adjustment
for age, gender, blood pressure, body mass index, heart rate and LV mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: Global longitudinal LV and RV strain is reduced in patients with RA 
compared with healthy patients. Strain abnormalities correlate with RA disease
severity. Strain imaging by echocardiography may detect early myocardial
dysfunction in RA.

Does minor trauma in pregnancy affect perinatal outcome?

Garmi G(1), Marjieh M, Salim R.

Author information:

Israel.

PURPOSE: To investigate pregnancy outcome after minor trauma and to identify risk
factors at admission that may predict adverse pregnancy outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective study held between January-2005 and December-2011.
Pregnant women at 23 weeks or more, who were admitted due to minor trauma, were
included. A standard protocol was applied: physical examination, lab tests and a 
fetal heart rate monitoring (FHRM) and tocometer for 1 h. In cases of symptomatic
women, abnormal FHRM or presence of uterine contractions, the length of
monitoring was extended. All women were admitted for 24 h of observation. The
primary outcome was a composite adverse outcome that included at least one of the
following: placental abruption, preterm birth and birthweight <2,500 g. To
investigate pregnancy outcome and identify risk factors that may predict
pregnancy outcome, matched (1:2) non-trauma controls were included. Risk factors 
examined included maternal obstetric variables, complaints at admission, clinical
findings, lab test results, FHRM and tocometer findings.
RESULTS: A total of 512 women with minor trauma and 1,024 non-trauma controls
were included. Composite outcome occurred in 48 (9.4 %) and 131 (12.9 %) of the
study and the control groups, respectively (p = 0.04; OR 0.71; 95 % CI,
0.5-0.99). None of the parameters examined at admission predicted the occurrence 
of the composite outcome.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women after minor trauma have a favorable pregnancy outcome.
None of the parameters examined at admission were predictive of adverse outcome. 
Extensive evaluation at admission and observation for 24 h are probably
unnecessary following minor trauma, particularly for asymptomatic women.

Working from a model of neurovisceral integration, we examined whether adding
response contingencies and motivational involvement would increase the need for
cardiac autonomic regulation in maintaining effective cognitive control.
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was recorded during variants of the Stroop
color-word task. The Basic task involved "accepting" congruent items and
"rejecting" words printed in incongruent colors (BLUE in red font); an added
contingency involved rejecting a particular congruent word (e.g., RED in red
font), or a congruent word repeated on an immediately subsequent trial.
Motivation was increased by adding a financial incentive phase. Results indicate 
that pre-task RSA predicted accuracy best when response contingencies required
the maintenance of a specific item in memory or on the Basic Stroop task when
errors resulted in financial loss. Overall, RSA appeared to be most relevant to
performance when the task encouraged a more proactive style of cognitive control,
a control strategy thought to be more metabolically costly, and hence, more
reliant on flexible cardiac autonomic regulation.

The association between anxiety, depression, and endothelial function (EF) was
assessed in a sample of 295 cardiac outpatients (n=222 men; mean age=59).
Patients were administered the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory, trait scale. EF was assessed through forearm hyperemic
reactivity, a nuclear medicine variation of the flow-mediated dilatation
technique, which calculates the rate of uptake ratio (RUR) between hyperaemic and
non-hyperaemic arms. Neither effect of anxiety (F=1.40, p=.24) nor depression
(F=2.66, p=.10) was found in a model predicting EF, however there was an
interaction (F=4.11, p=.04). Higher anxiety and lower depressive symptoms were
associated with superior RUR compared to lower anxiety and lower depressive
symptoms. Anxiety had no influence on RUR in those patients with higher
depressive symptoms, who generally displayed the lowest levels of RUR, i.e., poor
function. It is speculative whether this potential protective role of anxiety may
be guided by behavioral or physiological mechanisms.

This study examined the association between impulsivity and heart rate reactions 
to a brief psychological stress in pre-adolescent children. Impulsivity was
assessed by two response inhibition tasks and maternal self-report. Heart rate
was measured at rest and in response to a mental arithmetic challenge. Children
high in impulsivity showed blunted cardiac stress reactions. This result
resonates with previous findings that blunted stress reactivity is characteristic
of a range of problematic behaviours often associated with impulsivity.

Abstract Objective. To evaluate the relationship between functional capacity and 
left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) myocardial deformation, assessed by
two- and three-dimensional (2DE and 3DE) strain analysis, in subjects with
high-normal blood pressure (BP). Methods. This cross-sectional study included 64 
subjects with optimal BP and 75 subjects with high-normal BP of similar gender
and age. All the subjects underwent a complete 2DE and 3DE examination and
cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Results. 3DE global longitudinal strain was
significantly lower in the group with high-normal BP than in the optimal BP group
(- 20.1 ± 2.4 vs - 18.5 ± 2.3%, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained for 3DE
global circumferential strain (- 21.8 ± 2.6 vs - 19.3 ± 2.4%, p < 0.001), as well
as for 3DE global radial strain (45.1 ± 8.8 vs 42.3 ± 7.2%, p = 0.042), and 3DE
global area strain (- 30.1 ± 4.2 vs - 28.1 ± 3.8%, p < 0.001). LV twist was
similar between the observed groups, whereas untwisting rate was significantly
decreased in the subjects with high-normal BP (- 123 ± 30 vs - 112 ± 26°/s, p =
0.023). Peak VO2 was significantly lower in the high-normal BP group (30.8 ± 4 vs
28.3 ± 3.7 ml/kg/min, p < 0.001). 2DE LV ejection fraction (β = 0.38, p = 0.014),
2DE global longitudinal strain (β = 0.35, p = 0.019) and 3DE global longitudinal 
strain (β = 0.27, p = 0.042) were independently associated with peak VO2.
Conclusion. LV and LA mechanics, as well as functional capacity are significantly
impaired in the subjects with high-normal BP. LV and LA myocardial deformations
are associated with peak oxygen uptake.
