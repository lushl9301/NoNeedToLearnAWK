**Frailty**, the loss of physiologic organ reserve with age, and chronic illness, such as heart disease and stroke, which may accelerate the development of frailty, become the dominant determinants of ill-health in those who escape the hazards of early and mid-life.

Use **Frailty** to predict **stroke** before it really happens

1. find relation between **Frailty** and **stroke**

2. text mining related factor:
    
    - Inertial measurement unit (IMU) 
    
    - Electromyography (EMG)

The first part could use the same strategy as my first project. Second one could be more difficult.
